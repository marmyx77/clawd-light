/// This exists for the one fact Ghostty's dictionary will not give up. It lists
/// a surface's id, its title and its folder, and on a real machine none of the
/// three tells two conversations apart: two Codex sessions in
/// `~/Development/turing`, both titled `turing`, and a click could only ever
/// raise the first of them. Every other host answers this — Terminal.app and
/// iTerm2 expose the tty, WezTerm does, kitty matches on the pid — so Ghostty
/// was the only place where the panel had to guess, and a row that leads to the
/// wrong tab is worse than one that admits it does not know.
///
/// So the question is asked the other way round. The panel knows the tty and
/// Ghostty does not expose it; Ghostty knows the surface id and the panel cannot
/// derive it. Write a title nobody would choose to that tty, ask which surface
/// now carries it, put the old one back. The surface that changed **is** the
/// surface on that tty — a measurement, not a plausible guess.
///
/// Writing to a slave pty is a **display, never an input**: the bytes travel to
/// the emulator holding the master, which is how `wall` and `write(1)` have
/// always worked. Nothing is typed into the program running there, and the
/// sequence itself prints nothing.
